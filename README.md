TEXT MESSAGE VIEWER

To use this application:
You must have a SMS store as created by an app such
as SMSBackup in XML format. Once you have run SMS backup
on your mobile device, and you have transferred the file
to your computer, do the following:
    1. Click 'Choose SMS file'
    2. Navigate to the file on you computer and click 'Open'
The application will now display a list of all of the contacts
that have been found within the SMS store.
To view messages between you and another user, click on that
specific user's name. Once you have done this, the messages that
had been sent between the two of you will be displayed on the
right side of the application window. You can scroll through the
messages freely.
If you want to open another SMS file, there is no need to close
and re-open the application. Clicking on the 'Choose SMS file'
button and opening a new SMS file suffices.

To search for occurrences of a word (or more accurately a string
of text) in any of the messages, use the search bar located at the
top of the interface. Simply type the phrase you are looking to
match and click 'Search' (or hit the enter key). The messages
that contain matches to the words will then be displayed. If you
click the message, you will be taken to the specific conversation
that the message was taken from and the application will automatically
scroll to the spot that contains the searched message.

NOTE:
    This program is only verified to work with the XML files
    output by the following Android applications:
        SMS Backup & Restore
        Super Backup

    When searching for terms, it appears that you must click on
    the name to redirect to the conversation that the searched
    message came from. Further, searching can take a long amount
    of time if a very common phrase (such as a single letter) is
    searched or if the conversation that you are being redirected
    to contains many messages.

    Also, the application doesn't currently display GroupChats correctly.
