TEXT MESSAGE VIEWER

To use this application:
You must have a SMS store as created by an app such
as SMSBackup in XML format. Once you have run SMS backup
on your mobile device, and you have transferred the file
to your computer, do the following:
    1. Click 'Choose SMS file'
    2. Navigate to the file on you computer and click 'Open'
The application will now display a list of all of the contacts
that have been found within the SMS store.
To view messages between you and another user, click on that
specific user's name. Once you have done this, the messages that
had been sent between the two of you will be displayed on the
right side of the application window. You can scroll through the
messages freely.
If you want to open another SMS file, there is no need to close
and re-open the application. Clicking on the 'Choose SMS file'
button and opening a new SMS file suffices.

NOTE:
    This program is only verified to work with the XML files
    output by the SMSBackup Android Application.
